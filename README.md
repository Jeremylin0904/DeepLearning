## Interpreting and Understanding Deep Networks

### [ExplanationMethods.ipynb](ExplanationMethods.ipynb)
This notebook explores various methods for interpreting and understanding deep neural networks.

### [ModelBias.ipynb](ModelBias.ipynb)
In this notebook, we investigate techniques to identify and mitigate biases present in deep learning models.

### [Memorization_practical_PartI.ipynb](Memorization_practical_PartI.ipynb)
This notebook covers practical exercises related to memorization phenomenon in deep networks.

### [Memorization_practical_PartII.ipynb](Memorization_practical_PartII.ipynb)
Continuing from Part I, this notebook further explores memorization in deep networks with additional exercises.

## Under-supervised Deep Learning

### [SimCLR.ipynb](SimCLR.ipynb)
The SimCLR notebook demonstrates the implementation and application of the SimCLR framework for under-supervised deep learning.

### [FixMatch.ipynb](FixMatch.ipynb)
This notebook presents the FixMatch algorithm and its implementation for semi-supervised learning tasks.
